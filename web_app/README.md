# WorldBankApp

## Project Motivation
This projects extracts various datasets on land use in the top 10 world Economies from World Bank Open Data and visualises it in a dashboard. The result can be seen here [http://dumle975.pythonanywhere.com/] (note that website is not actively maintained).


## Installation
The requirements.txt file lists all Python libraries that are required for this project and they can be installed using:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
To be able to test the code locally, first you have to remove the */home/dumle975/WorldBankApp/web_app/* absolute paths in this repository as PythonAnywhere works with absolute paths (where the website is deployed).

To run the code locally, type:
```
python worldbank.py
```
, in your shell. Then go to http://localhost:3001 to view the site.
